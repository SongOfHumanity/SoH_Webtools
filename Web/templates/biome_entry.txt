			<Description>
				This section contains a collection of terms and definitions essential for documenting various aspects of biomes within The Valley. 
				These terms are grouped into four categories—Hydrological Terms, Geological Terms, Soil Types, and Common Flora Terms—providing 
				a comprehensive lexicon for describing environmental features, soil composition, and vegetation layers. 
				Each category helps ensure consistency in how we reference water flow, rock formations, soil profiles, and plant life across diverse biomes.

		<Section Title = "Biome Entry Template">
			<Description>
				This section provides a unified template for documenting **Biomes** within The Valley, aligning with the approach used for Fauna and Flora references. 
				By applying this structured format, each biome entry—whether forest, plains, hills, wetlands, waterways, grasslands, mountains, or caves—maintains consistent core sections (Overview, Environment, Human Interaction, etc.), while allowing optional "Branches" for more specialized details (e.g., sub-zones, unique resources, critical hydrology). 
				The goal is to ensure clarity, uniformity, and depth across The Valley’s Biome Index, facilitating easier cross-referencing, incremental expansions, and synergy with Fauna/Flora references.
			</Description>
			
			<Guide Type = "Template" Sub-Type = "_list">
				<li0_a Type = "Description" Sub-Type = "Overview">
					Biome Entry Template Usage Instructions:
				</li0_a>
				
				<li.d Title = "Scope and Usage">
					This template is used for documenting **Biomes** within The Valley, accommodating both **Major Biomes** (which contain multiple **Divisions**) and **Minor Biomes** (which stand alone).  
					Each biome is assigned a **Biome Code** and, when applicable, **Sub-Biome Codes** to ensure clarity across references.  
			
					Additionally, each Biome Entry includes a **Biome Type Selector** (`IsBiome_Type?`), which determines the relevant **optional elements and modules** applicable to the Biome.  
				</li.d>
				
				<li.e Title = "Major vs. Minor Biomes">
					All Biomes require a **Boolean Definition**:  
					- `REQ IsBiome_Major? = True` → Indicates a **Major Biome** (includes Divisions).  
					- `REQ IsBiome_Major? = False` → Indicates a **Minor Biome** (standalone; no Divisions section).  
				</li.e>
				
				<li.f Title = "Biome Type Selector">
					Each Biome must be assigned a **Biome Type** to determine the appropriate **optional modules**:  
					`REQ IsBiome_Type? = [Cave, Forest, Grassland, Hill, Mountain, Plain, Waterway, Wetland]`  
			
					Based on the Biome Type selection, **additional content branches** are dynamically included:  
					- **Waterway, Wetland, Mountain, Cave:** → Includes `Hydrology` Section  
					- **Forest, Grassland, Hill, Plain:** → Includes `Soil Composition` Section  
					- **Mountain, Cave:** → Includes `Interior Features` (for caves, tunnels, or karst systems)  
					- **Hill, Mountain:** → Includes `Mineral Resources` (geological deposits, mining history)  
				</li.f>
				
				<li.g Title = "Template Sections">
					Each Biome Entry follows a structured format with these core sections:  
					- **Overview**: General description, boundaries, climate.  
					- **Divisions (if Major Biome)**: Sub-Biome Codes (`D₁, E₂`) define internal divisions.  
					- **Environment**: Climate, soil composition, hydrology, and seasonal variations.  
					- **Features**: Terrain, flora, fauna, mineral resources, or unique biome traits.  
					- **Human Interaction**: Settlements, cultural significance, and economic importance.  
					- **Overall Significance**: Ecological role, historical importance, or keystone species.  
					Each section starts with a **bolded header and colon**, ensuring consistency.  
				</li.g>
				
				<li.h Title = "Divisions and Sub-Biome Codes">
					For **Major Biomes**, sub-zones are listed in the "Divisions" section.  
					- **Format**: `Biotype_Code + Subscript Index` (e.g., `D₁: Northern Marshwood`, `E₂: Western Flats`).  
					- **Cross-Referencing**: These ensure clear connections to other Biome, Fauna, or Flora documentation.  
				</li.h>
				
				<li.i Title = "Modules and Branches">
					Some Biomes require additional detail through **Modules**, determined by `IsBiome_Type?`:  
					- **Forest Module**: Tree composition, canopy layers, distinct ecological sub-zones.  
					- **Waterways Module**: Flow patterns, riparian zones, seasonal variation.  
					- **Hills Module**: Elevation zones, mineral deposits, land formations.  
					- **Mountains Module**: Elevation breakdown, interior cave systems, mineral wealth.  
			
					- **Optional Branches** can add:  
						- **Hydrology**: Key for Wetlands, Waterways, and Mountain sources.  
						- **Interior Features**: Cave networks, tunnels (used for Mountains and Underground Biomes).  
						- **Cultural Significance**: Tied to local traditions, historical events, or mythological importance.  
						- **Economic Importance**: Details industries such as logging, agriculture, or mining.  
						- **Common Flora & Fauna**: Major species if not already covered in Features.  
				</li.i>
				
				<li.j Title = "Cross-Referencing and Consistency">
					Where relevant, cross-reference **Fauna, Flora, and Societal Documentation**:  
					- Use **standardized Biome Codes** (e.g., `Forest_D`, `Hills_K`) to align expansions.  
					- **Fauna Cross-Reference**: Mention keystone species tied to the Biome.  
					- **Flora Cross-Reference**: Detail plant species distribution.  
					- **Cultural Tie-Ins**: Reference settlements, traditional uses, or historical events.  
				</li.j>
				
				<li.k Title = "Future Expansion and Modularity">
					Like Fauna and Flora entries, Biome documentation remains **expandable**:  
					- Start with a **basic Overview** and minimal data.  
					- Expand with new **Modules** for complex Biomes (e.g., **Hydrology, Elevation, Mineral Resources**).  
					- Maintain **consistent section headings** for ease of retrieval and referencing.  
				</li.k>
