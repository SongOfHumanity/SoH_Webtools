			</li0_a>
		
			<li.d Title = "Scope and Usage">
				This template is used for documenting **Fauna Entries** within The Valley, supporting both **wild and domesticated species**. 
				Each entry follows a **structured format** that ensures consistency across The Valley’s ecosystem records, facilitating 
				cross-referencing with the **Fauna Index, Biome Entries, and Societal References**.
			</li.d>
		
			<li.e Title = "Required Fields (REQ)">
				Every Fauna Entry must define the following **required fields** to ensure proper classification and indexing:
				- **IsFauna_Type?** = `[Bird, Mammal, Reptile, Amphibian, Invertebrate, Fish]`  
				  _(Determines classification according to Index_Fauna.)_  
				- **IsFauna_Domesticated?** = `[None, Livestock, Working, Companion]`  
				  _(Specifies if the species is domesticated, and for what purpose.)_  
				- **IsFauna_Endemic?** = `Boolean`  
				  _(Indicates whether the species is exclusive to one or more specific Biomes.)_  
				- **IsFauna_Migratory?** = `Boolean`  
				  _(Marks if the species undergoes seasonal migration.)_

			</li.e>
		
			<li.f Title = "Fauna Symbols and Meaning">
				Fauna Entries automatically apply **Symbols** based on selected attributes.
				(❦, ↺, (◎ or ✿ or ◬ or ☆))
				These symbols appear in the **Entry Header** (`{Symbols}; {Species_Name}`) and in **directory listings** for quick reference.
			</li.f>
		
			<li.g Title = "Template Sections">
				Each Fauna Entry follows a structured format containing **core sections** and **optional expansions**:  
				- **Overview**: Name, aliases, and quick classification.  
				- **Description**: Detailed breakdown of **physical attributes**, with variable verbosity.  
				- **Habitat**: Where the species resides and its biome preferences.  
				- **Nature & Behavior**: Daily activity, diet, life cycle, and social structures.

				- **Human & Societal References**: When discussing **domestication, folklore, or historical connections**.  
			</li.i>
		
			<li.j Title = "Symbol-Based Sorting in Directories">
				Fauna Entries are sorted **visually and functionally** based on **Symbol Assignments**:
