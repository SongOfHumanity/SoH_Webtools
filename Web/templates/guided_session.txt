<Section Title = "Guided Session Template">  
	<Description>  
		The Guided Session Template is designed to **plan complex, multi-activity efforts**  
		that exceed the scope of a single `<Activity>`. It acts as a **container for multiple  
		Titled Activities**, with optional `<Task>` breakdowns for modular execution.  
		
		Use this template when a feature or initiative spans **multiple resources, entities,  
		or workstreams**, and needs a structured plan before execution.  
	</Description>  
	
	<Guide Type = "Template" Sub-Type = "_list">  
		<li.d Title = "Purpose & Utilization">  
			- Organizes **large initiatives** into a parent Session containing Activities.  
			- Provides a **repeatable planning structure** for complex work.  
			- Allows `<Task>`-level modularity under each Activity.  
		</li.d>  
		
		<li.e Title = "Structure Breakdown">  
			- **`<Session{Cluster}-{Subnode}-{Session_Index}>`** → Master container.  
			- **`<Activity>`** → Core atomic unit; each Activity has its own title.  
			- **`<Task>`** → Optional smaller units inside an Activity.  
			- **`<Conclusion>`** → Summarizes outcomes and next steps.  
		</li.e>  
		
		<li.f Title = "Best Practices">  
			- Keep Activities **scoped to a single objective**.  
			- Use Tasks when an Activity contains **multiple dependencies**.  
			- Include **collaborators and resources** for each Activity.  
			- Maintain **clear titles** for quick indexing and retrieval.  
		</li.f>
