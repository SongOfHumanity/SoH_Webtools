### 📔; Reflection_Entry
<Description>
   Reflection Entries are personal, narrative-style observations tied to activities, collaborations, or milestones.  
   They emphasize growth, challenges, and lessons in context.  
   Each entry is timestamped and structured for clarity, but allows space for a more natural, reflective voice.  
</Description>

<Guide>
	1. **Date**: Always `mm/dd/yyyy`. Anchor the reflection in time.  
	2. **Activity Section**: Identify collaborators, project, node, and keywords.  
	- This helps cross-reference reflections against Meta and Index documents.  
	3. **Summary**: Concise overview of what occurred and what was learned.  
	4. **Highlights**: Extract and frame what was significant.  
	- 2–3 is typical, but more can be included.  
	5. **Guide Section**: Advice to “future me” and the team—lessons, cautions, or suggested methods.
