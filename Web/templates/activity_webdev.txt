<Section Title = "Web-Based Feature Implementation">  
	<Description>  
		This Guided Activity Template is designed to plan, implement, and document  
		web-based features inside the SoH Webtools suite. It ties together a  
		structured Guide, an actionable Activity, and optional Reflection and  
		Changelog outputs for complete development records.  
		
		Use this template when creating new tools, extending existing views, or  
		shipping UI/UX improvements.  
	</Description>  
	
	<Guide Type = "Template" Sub-Type = "_list">  
		<li.d Title = "Purpose & Utilization">  
			- Defines a **repeatable development loop** for Webtools features.  
			- Ensures **planning, execution, reflection, and logging** are captured.  
			- Supports **collaborative AI + human workflows** by clarifying steps.  
		</li.d>  
		
		<li.e Title = "Structure Breakdown">  
			- **`<Guide Title>`** → Names the feature being implemented.  
			- **`<Activity>`** → Step-by-step build plan and execution tasks.  
			- **`<Reflection>`** → Optional recap of outcomes and lessons.  
			- **`<Changelog>`** → Entry draft for the relevant log file.  
		</li.e>  
		
		<li.f Title = "Best Practices">  
			- Keep steps **atomic and verifiable** (design → build → test).  
			- Call out **files, identifiers, and UI targets** explicitly.  
			- Capture **decisions and lessons** in Reflection when possible.  
			- Log changes using **Action + Category classifiers**.  
		</li.f>  
	</Guide>  

	<Note>  
		- Favor **homebrewed implementations** when reasonable.  
		- Build in-context so the toolkit stays **self-contained and stable**.  
		- Follow Rule #1: **show your work** in each commit so others can trace the path.  
		- Breakages should be attributable to **internal changes**, not upstream shifts.  
	</Note>
