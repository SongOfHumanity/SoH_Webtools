		<Description>
			This reference document establishes the standardized framework for documenting minerals, stones, and ores within The Valley. It introduces essential geological terms, a structured template for consistent entry creation, and guidelines that balance scientific accuracy with cultural significance. Minerals, being both natural resources and symbolic artefacts, are recorded here to support ecological research, material studies, cultural lore, and economic records in The Valley.

		<Section Title = "Mineral Entry Template">
			<Description>
				This section provides a consistent structure for documenting minerals within The Valley. Each entry balances geological properties with cultural context, ensuring clarity for researchers and resonance for storytellers.

			<Guide Type = "Template" Sub-Type = "_list">
				<li0_a Type = "Description" Sub-Type = "Overview">Mineral Entry Template Usage Instructions:</li0_a>
				<li.d Title = "Header">
					Start with the mineral’s name, aliases, and classification (e.g., "Verdestone (Valley Emerald) — Silicate Gemstone").
				</li.d>
				<li.e Title = "Description Sections">
					Core sections include: **Description**, **Composition & Properties**, **Occurrence & Formation**, **Ecological & Geological Role**, **Human Relationship**, and **Additional Notes**.
				</li.e>
				<li.f Title = "Optional Branching Sections">
					- **Gemstone Qualities**: If the mineral is valued ornamentally, add clarity, cut, and symbolism notes.  
					- **Ore Significance**: If classified as an ore, add a branch on extraction, trade, and historical impact.  
					- **Ritual or Symbolic Use**: If culturally significant, add a branch on ceremonies, beliefs, or myths.
				</li.f>
				<li.g Title = "Cross-References">
					Link to related entries: flora (plants associated with deposits), fauna (creatures tied to mining or symbolism), and characters or societies that interact with the mineral.
				</li.g>
				<li.h Title = "Consistency">
					Ensure formatting is uniform, and terminology matches the defined Mineral Terms. Branches should be clearly marked when invoked.
				</li.h>
