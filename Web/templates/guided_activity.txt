<Section Title = "Guided Activity Template">  
	<Description>  
		The Guided Activity Template is designed to **structure and execute planned activities**  
		in a clear, repeatable format.  
		
		By defining **steps, objectives, and collaborative efforts**, this format enables  
		**efficient execution, documentation, and refinement** of activities.  
		
		Each **Guided Activity** is self-contained within a `<Guide>` and structured into  
		actionable steps within an `<Activity>`.  
	</Description>  
	
	<Guide Type = "Template" Sub-Type = "_list">  
		<li.d Title = "Purpose & Utilization">  
			- Used to **plan, structure, and document** activities requiring multiple steps.  
			- Ensures **consistent execution** of complex or recurring tasks.  
			- Provides a **clear framework** for collaborative efforts across multiple Nodes.  
		</li.d>  
		
		<li.e Title = "Structure Breakdown">  
			- **`<Guide Title>`** → Names the Guided Activity.  
			- **`<Introduction>`** → Establishes objectives and context.  
			- **`<Activity>`** → Lists **actionable steps**, defining tasks and sub-tasks.  
			- **`<Conclusion>`** → Summarizes expected outcomes and benefits.  
		</li.e>  
		
		<li.f Title = "Practical Applications">  
			- **Long-Term Projects** → Structures ongoing efforts with **clear milestones**.  
			- **Cross-Node Collaboration** → Ensures **cohesive workflows** across Entities.  
			- **Knowledge Standardization** → Creates **repeatable methodologies** for similar tasks.  
		</li.f>  
		
		<li.g Title = "Best Practices">  
			- Define **clear objectives** in the **Introduction**.  
			- Use **actionable, specific steps** in the **Activity** section.  
			- Ensure **collaborators and key Nodes** are noted when applicable.  
			- Maintain **concise yet informative** structure for quick reference.
