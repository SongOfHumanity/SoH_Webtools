		<Section Title = "Flora Entry Template">
			<Description>
				This section presents a standardized template for documenting flora within The Valley. By following a consistent structure—covering description, habitat, life cycle, ecological role, human relationships, and cultural significance—contributors can create comprehensive plant entries. As with fauna, these entries should maintain consistency, referencing defined terms from the Flora Terms lists to ensure accuracy and ease of cross-referencing.

			<Guide Type = "Template" Sub-Type = "_list">
				<li0_a Type = "Description" Sub-Type = "Overview">Flora Entry Template Usage Instructions:</li0_a>
				<li.d Title = "Header">
					Start with the plant species name and any significant common names, nicknames, or aliases.
				</li.d>
				<li.e Title = "Description Sections">
					Organize the entry into core sections: **Description**, **Habitat**, **Growth & Life Cycle**, **Ecological Role**, **Propagative Interactions**, **Relationship with Humans**, and **Additional Notes**.
				</li.e>
				<li.f Title = "Description Types Usage">
					In the **Description** section, you may include multiple detail levels (Brief, Basic, Verbose) depending on context:
						- **Brief Description:** A concise snapshot of the plant’s most distinctive features.
						- **Basic Description:** A moderate level of detail describing the plant’s general appearance and characteristics.
						- **Verbose Description:** In-depth coverage of morphology, seasonal changes, distinctive traits, and structural adaptations.
				</li.f>
				<li.g Title = "Optional Branching Sections">
					In certain sections, additional branches can be included for more detail:
						- **Growth & Life Cycle**:
							- **Reproduction & Pollination** (Branch): Details on pollination strategies, flowering/fruiting periods, and seed dispersal.
						- **Relationship with Humans**:
							- **Cultural Significance** (Branch): Exploring medicinal uses, folklore, symbolic meanings, and culinary importance.
				</li.g>
				<li.h Title = "Content Quality">
					Use clear, precise language. When applicable, integrate terms from the defined Flora Terms sections to maintain consistency.
				</li.h>
				<li.i Title = "Cross-References">
					Where relevant, reference related flora, fauna, or biomes documented elsewhere. This strengthens the interconnected understanding of The Valley’s ecology.
				</li.i>
				<li.j Title = "Consistency">
					Maintain consistent formatting across all flora entries, allowing for easy comparison, educational use, and reliable data integration.
