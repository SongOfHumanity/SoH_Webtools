		<Description>
			The **Character Entries Reference** defines the canonical structure, requirements, and formatting standards for all character documentation across *The Valley* and related Settings. 
			Characters are dynamic, evolving entities—shaped by relationships, affiliations, conflicts, and arcs over time. This Reference provides a unified system to capture their identity, motivations, affiliations, and narrative function, while remaining modular and extensible through optional components.

		<Section1 Title = "Character Entry Template">
			<Description>
				The Character Entry Template is the foundational structure for all character documentation within the Narrative Framework. 
				It defines the canonical format and ordering of metadata, descriptive elements, and narrative fields required to portray a character in a consistent and indexable way. 
				All entries—regardless of affiliation, role, or complexity—begin from this template. Nested elements such as `<Description>`, `<Traits>`, `<Background>`, and `<Quotes>` provide a structured space to capture the identity, motivation, relationships, and voice of a character. 
				This section serves as the blueprint from which every Character Entry is built, ensuring interoperability across systems and predictable output for downstream processing.

		<Section2 Title="Character REQ; Affiliation_Type">
			<Description>
				This section defines the core **requirement** for every Character Entry: at least one `<Affiliation>` type. 
				Affiliations act as the primary linkage point between characters and the larger societal, political, or organizational structures of the world. 
				They determine the context in which a character operates, the roles they fulfill, and the relationships that shape their narrative significance. 
				The Affiliation schema provided here establishes the base set of recognized organizations—such as *The Luminary*, *The Pact*, and *Tinkers Union*—and can be expanded with additional types as the world develops. 
				Because the Affiliation Type is essential for indexing and cross-referencing, it must always be resolved before a Character Entry can be considered complete.

		</Section2>
		<Section3 Title="Character REQ: OPTION">
			<Description>
				This section defines optional modules that may extend or enhance a Character Entry beyond the required template. 
				Options allow creators to add depth or specificity without altering the core structure, enabling modular growth over time. 
				The primary optional module currently supported is the `<Companion>` template, which documents bonded creatures or entities and their narrative relationship to the character. 
				Future optional modules may include expanded treatments of relationships, legacies, or specialized roles. 
				These components are additive rather than required, providing flexibility for complex storytelling while maintaining consistency with the base format.
