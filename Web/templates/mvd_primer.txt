### **PRIMER:{Domain}**

*(One page = one mental model)*

---

### 1. **Scope**

**What this page governs.**
One sentence. No flavor.

> *Defines how civic authority, law enforcement, and external jurisdictions interact within Silverwall.*

---

### 2. **Core Principles**

**Non-negotiable truths.**
3–6 bullets. These are the rules the setting *cannot* violate without consequence.

Example:

* Civil authority and military authority are separate.
* No individual faction holds absolute power.
* Emergency powers are temporary and reviewable.
* External treaties override local ambition.

If a story breaks one of these, it should *cause friction*.

---

### 3. **Actors & Roles**

**Who exists in this system, not who they are personally.**

Format:

* **Role** → Function → Limits

Example:

* **Mayor** → Civil adjudication, coordination → No military command
* **Small Council** → Legislation, budget oversight → Cannot command Guard
* **Town Guard** → Enforcement, defense → No legislative authority
* **Adventurer’s Guild** → Regulates adventurers → No civilian governance
* **Elven Envoy** → Treaty oversight → Veto on boundary violations

No names here. Names live elsewhere.

---

### 4. **Authority Flow**

**Who decides → who enforces → who reviews**

This can be bullets or a tiny schematic:

* Policy → Mayor / Council
* Enforcement → Guard
* Guild matters → Guild tribunal
* Treaty matters → Council + Envoy
* Serious crimes → Regional justice

This section is gold for narrative consistency.

---

### 5. **Escalation Paths**

**“If X happens, it goes here.”**

Examples:

* Minor dispute → Mayor
* Guild member violation → Guard arrest → Guild sanction
* Treaty breach → Guard stop → Envoy review → Council diplomacy
* Emergency → Mayor edict → Guard action → Council review

This prevents hand-wavy outcomes.

---

### 6. **Interfaces**

**Where this system touches others.**

Short list:

* Interfaces with **Adventurer’s Guild** (contracts, discipline)
* Interfaces with **Elven Treaty** (Mistwood boundary)
* Interfaces with **Regional Authority** (high crimes)

This is what lets other Primer pages “snap together.”

---

### 7. **Narrative Levers** *(Optional but powerful)*

**What stories this system naturally creates.**

3–5 bullets max:

* Political deadlock vs urgent threat
* Guard refusal vs Mayor pressure
* Guild leverage in town policy
* Treaty tension at the forest edge

This is where We feast later — *but the Primer stays lean*.
