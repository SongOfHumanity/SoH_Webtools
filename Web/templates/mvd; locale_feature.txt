## **Featured Entry**
##### `indexContainer: [🔩,🔮, 👤, 🐾, 📦, 🛎️, 🐓]`
**Features** are Containers for a variety of elements, and provide details related to the physical Area of any particular landmark. 1BV is a place for about four people to work or live.

### `{DistrictID}{FeatureLetter}`– Feature Block
##### `{DistrictID}_index` (*implied*)
A specific location or landmark within a District.

#### **Field Explanation**
| **Field** | **Purpose and Rationale** | **Example/Notes** |
|-----------|---------------------------|-------------------|

### OPTION: **ConstructionStyle**

```
{ConstructionStyle}=[OPTION: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | hybrid]

1. **Timber & Daub** — Wood frame, wattle-and-daub walls, thatch or shake roof. Common, warm, prone to settling.
2. **Stone & Slate** — Cut stone or mortared fieldstone, slate roof. Upscale, durable, cold unless heated.
3. **Plank & Pitch** — Heavy timber planks, tar-sealed seams, simple roof. Functional, used for stables and barns.
4. **Brick & Tile** — Fired brick, clay tile roof. Rare, requires a kiln, long-lasting. Guild buildings, wealthy homes.
5. **Patchwork** — Salvaged materials, uneven construction, visible repairs. Functional but fragile.
6. **Canvas & Frame** — Tent-like structures, wood frame with oiled canvas. Market stalls, seasonal housing.
7. **Cob & Thatch** — Mud-and-straw walls, thick and insulating, thatched roof. Farmsteads, outlying homes.
```

**Usage:** Features can use one style, or a **hybrid** (e.g., *"Timber & Daub with Stone foundation"*).

#### 🔩– Component Block
##### `{DistrictID}{Feature Letter}🔩_index`

Components are used to break down **Complex Features** (5+ BV) into manageable sub-units. Each Component represents a distinct functional or spatial division within the Feature—e.g., *Main Hall*, *Kitchen*, *Storage*, *Coop*.

```
		🔩(1-9); **{ComponentName}** · {ComponentFunction}
			- {BV}BV{OPT: (Tall)|(Spread)} · {ConstructionStyle}
			- {Description[Brief]}
```

##### **Block Explanation**

| **Field** | **Purpose** | **Example/Notes** |
|-----------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Index** | `🔩(1-9)` | Local token for the Component within the Feature (e.g., `②ⓐ🔩1`). |
| **ComponentName** | Name of the sub-unit | *Main Hall*, *Kitchen*, *Storage Shed*, *Guest Rooms*, *Coop* |
| **ComponentFunction** | Primary purpose of this Component | *Dining and socializing*, *Food preparation*, *Dry goods storage*, *Lodging*, *Chicken housing* |
| **BV** | Building Value for this Component | *2*, *1*, *1 (Spread)* |
| **ConstructionStyle** | Material palette (from predefined list) | *Timber & Daub*, *Plank & Pitch*, *Stone foundation* |
| **Description** | Brief flavor text (1-2 sentences) | *"The main hall smells of stew and wood smoke, with long tables scarred by years of use."* |

### **Notes**
- Paths are **bidirectional by default** (if ③ connects to ①, then ① connects to ③).
- **Special Paths** (bridges, ferries, gates) should be noted in the `{PathType}` field.
- **Path Names** are optional but helpful for narrative purposes (*"Meet me at the Rivergate Bridge"*).
- Components are **optional**—only use them for Features with 5+ BV that need internal breakdown.
- Each Component can have its own **Inventory indices** (📦, 🛎️, 🐓) if needed, but this is rare. Usually, Inventory stays at the Feature level.
- Components inherit the Feature's **{Owner}** unless specified otherwise (e.g., a tenant in one wing of a building).
