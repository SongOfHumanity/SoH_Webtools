# MVD: INVENTORY *v0.7*
-------

## Featured Block: Inventory
The Inventory system provides a flexible, narrative-focused way to represent what a Feature offers—whether goods, services, or livestock. Rather than exhaustive lists, it uses **broad categories** with **imprecise descriptors** to capture stock levels, availability, and attitude. This keeps entries scannable while leaving room for improvisation and story-driven variation.
Each Inventory type is capped at **9 entries** to maintain focus and prevent bloat. 

---

#### 📦– Item Block 
*`{DistrictID}{FeatureLetter}`📦_index*

Items represent **physical goods** available for purchase, trade, or use. Categories group related products (e.g., *Small Leather Goods* instead of listing belts, pouches, and straps individually). Fields describe **how much is in stock**, **how easy it is to acquire**, and **what it costs** in relative terms.

```
		📦(1-9); **{ItemCategory}** · {Availability}
			- {Amount} · {CostIndicator}
			- {Description[Brief]}
```

---

#### 🛎️– Service Block 
*`{DistrictID}{FeatureLetter}`🛎️_index*

Services represent **labor or expertise** offered by the Feature's proprietor or staff. This includes repairs, custom work, consultations, and specialized tasks. The **Enthusiasm** field captures the provider's **willingness and capacity** to perform the service—independent of cost. A smith might charge fairly for blade repairs but loathe taking custom orders due to the complexity involved.

```
		🛎️(1-9); **{ServiceCategory}** · {Availability}
			- {Enthusiasm} · {CostIndicator}
			- {Description[Brief]}
```

---

#### 🐓– Fauna Block
*`{DistrictID}{FeatureLetter}`🐓_index*

Fauna represent **living animals** kept, traded, or raised at the Feature. This includes livestock, working animals, companions, and creatures held for sale. The **Purpose** field clarifies the animal's role (e.g., *Eggs and meat*, *Fieldwork*, *Guard duty*), while **Quantity** gives a rough sense of scale.

```
		🐓(1-9); **{AnimalType}** · {Availability}
			- {Quantity} · {Purpose}
			- {Description[Brief]}
```

### **Guide**

- **Availability is king.** It sits on the main line because "Can I get this *right now*?" is the first question in any narrative interaction.
- **Enthusiasm matters.** A blacksmith might *do* armor repairs, but if they're reluctant or exhausted by the work, that creates friction—and story.
- **Cost is relative.** *Affordable*, *Premium*, and *Negotiable* are intentionally vague. Exact prices aren't the point; the *feel* of the transaction is.
- **Descriptions stay short.** 1-2 sentences. Just enough to ground the category and hint at character or quality.
